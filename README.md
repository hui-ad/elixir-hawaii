# Philosophy
A site with events for a diverse community of developers, created by a diverse community of developers. Using the [Tyranny of Structurelessness essay, by Jo Freeman](https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm) as a basis for organization seems like a good start. Also, the idea of being *explicit* in offering ways for people to get involved (as proposed by the [P5JS community](http://p5js.org/community/), but not documented anywhere that I've seen) is a goal.

## This repo should contain
These things and more. If you don't see a markdown file for something you'd like to add, please add the file.
* potential speakers
* topics
* locations
* projects
* any decisions in progress

## Meetings
* "Content" meetings (presentations, talks, games, demos, etc.) are held once a month, on the 2nd Wednesday of the month.
* "Planning" meetings (to plan the "content" meetings and other loger term initiatives) are held once a month, on the 4th Tuesday of the month. They also serve as a chance to discussthe last "content" meeting and suggest improvements.

## Want to help?
We'd like to strive to be explicit in letting people know how to get involved. This includes figuring out how create opportunities for everyone. That said, we also have some ways to make suggestions, in case that's your thing:
* Use this issue template to [suggest a talk idea](https://github.com/hui-ad/shaka-ako/issues/new?template=Submit-a-talk-idea.md)
* You can also still [create a normal issue](https://github.com/hui-ad/shaka-ako/issues/new) (suggestion)

## Group Resources
* Institute website, our public UI ([repo here](https://github.com/hui-ad/institute), [website here](http://institute.gigalixirapp.com))
* Code of Conduct [Anonymous Abuse Reporting Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1X1VigBcyS_Z_sfR_QOuaYkSyk53aNyc8ZIqNMz6UtdI/edit), @axelson owner
