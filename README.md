# Philosophy
A site with events for a diverse community of developers, created by a diverse community of developers. Using the [Tyranny of Structurelessness essay, by Jo Freeman](https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm) as a basis for organization seems like a good start. Also, the idea of being *explicit* in offering ways for people to get involved (as proposed by the [P5JS community](http://p5js.org/community/), but not documented anywhere that I've seen) is a goal.
